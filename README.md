# webstep-slack-cvpartner

Create a slash command function for Slack. Or some kind of event subscription bot? 

Use data from CVPartner to query and retrieve information about consultants' experience, skills and more.

# Simple architecture

1. Use a Slack app with slash command functionality
2. Use an API gateway as our Slack app's endpoint
3. Use serverless Lambda functions to process response from CVPartner
